**Hi team**

I'm [Laurent](https://twitter.com/Laurent_VB).

I am a full-stack developer, mainly with javascript but through the years I've worked with php, java, ruby on rails and python.

I founded https://www.givebriq.com and I love making simple products that help people.

Happy to meet you all.
